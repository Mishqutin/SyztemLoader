Shitty manual in how to do something with this piece of shit.
Step 1:
Start syz.bat (It is not recommended to run it as an admin)
Step 2:
When you are able to see '-Press Shift+W...' do it so you can access shit that looks like BIOS.
Step 3:
Press Shift+R. config.py will configure some thingy things and create dirs at your documents (Syztem\prgs).
Step 4:
Press w to save.
Step 5:
Have fun and try help command.

Where to put fucking programs that can be run by PyQutin (this is also a priority of where it looks for files):
*Current Workin' Dir
*SyztemLoader\data\home\software
*Documents\Syztem\prgs
Every program must be .py.
Programs are executed by: exec(<file-content>)

TextEditor is now fuckin stupid so don't ever try to use it.
Try edit <file>
