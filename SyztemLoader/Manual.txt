Shitty manual in how to do something with this piece of shit.
Step 1:
Start syz.bat (It is not recommended to run it as an admin)
Step 2:
When you are able to see '-Press Shift+W...' do it so you can access shit that looks like BIOS.
Step 3:
Press Shift+R. config.py will configure some thingy things and create dirs at your documents (Syztem\prgs).
Step 4:
Press w to save.
Step 5:
Have fun and try help command.

And first of all..
NEVER EVER FOREVER FEVER TRY TO USE HELP SCMD!!!! IT IS OUTDATED!!!

Where to put fucking programs that can be run by PyQutin (this is also a priority of where it looks for files):
*Current Workin' Dir
*SyztemLoader\data\home\software
*Documents\Syztem\prgs
Every program must be .py.
Programs are executed by: exec(<file-content>)

TextEditor is now fuckin stupid so don't ever try to use it.
Try edit <file>

Variables:
First of all you will need to declare or define a variable. I fucking don't know.
Type in 'dcl a'. It will make 'a' an variable, default value is NOTHING! VOID! OR ANY-NO-NotTHING ELSE FUUUUUCK!!!!
NOTHING REALLY EXISTS! EVERYTHING IS ALLOWED!!
Ok ok. Let's calm down.
Now you can do anything with it.
Some syntaxes (first line you type second is output):
a
<Value of a>
Any expression (1; 1+2; 42676+3412-5-3425*45/3456*4**543467)
Result
a 2
<Nothing just sets a to int 2>
a <Any expression>
<Sets it>
a $a+$b
<Sets it's value + var b value>


Put somewhere a file, eg. YoMama.txt and put there anything you can type in PyQutin console.
You can run it by sz YoMama.txt.

Modes:
Type in 'mode scroll' and then use 'w' or 's' to scroll up n down or 'q' to fuck it out.

Majka the cat that sits on the table when I am doing all that stuff.
Marcel the Wi-Fi (read vaij faiwj (Wat?)) printer. It sometimes prints all the content of any file I try to edit (Because I often press
'Print' instead of 'Edit').

Nic - She can turn any value into Nothing. Wait wait wait...

Let me expalin this:
Nothing - No thing.
It has opposite meaning than a thing.
Means that there is no thing.
If there is no thing, then what's really here?
