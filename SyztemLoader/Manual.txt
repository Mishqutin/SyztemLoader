Shitty manual in how to do something with this piece of shit.
Step 1:
Start syz.bat (It is not recommended to run it as an admin)
Step 2:
When you are able to see '-Press Shift+W...' do it so you can access shit that looks like BIOS.
Step 3:
Press Shift+R. config.py will configure some thingy things and create dirs at your documents (Syztem).
Step 4:
Have fun and try help command.

And first of all..
NEVER EVER FOREVER FEVER TRY TO USE HELP SCMD!!!! IT IS OUTDATED!!!

Where to put fucking programs that can be run by PyQutin (this is also a priority of where it looks for files):
*Current Workin' Dir
*SyztemLoader\data\home\software
*Documents\Syztem\prgs
Every program must be .py.
Programs are executed by: exec(<file-content>)

TextEditor is still fuckin stupid so don't ever try to use it.
Try edit <file>

Variables:
First of all you will need to declare or define a variable. I fucking don't know.
Type in 'dcl a'. It will make 'a' an variable, default value is NOTHING! VOID! OR ANY-NO-NotTHING ELSE FUUUUUCK!!!!
NOTHING REALLY EXISTS! EVERYTHING IS ALLOWED!!
Ok ok. Let's calm down.
Now you can do anything with it.
Some syntaxes (first line you type second is output):
a
<Value of a>
Any expression (1; 1+2; 42676+3412-5-3425*45/3456*4**543467)
Result
a 2
<Nothing just sets a to int 2>
a <Any expression>
<Sets it>
a $a+$b
<Sets it's value + var b value>
a $a$b
<Use for strings>


Put somewhere a file, eg. YoMama.txt and put there anything you can type in PyQutin console.
You can run it by 'sz YoMama.txt'.

Modes:
Type in 'mode scroll' and then use 'w' or 's' to scroll up n down or 'q' to fuck it out.

Saving dirs:
You can save your favourite program path to quickly open it.
Also you can save a directory.
saveDir <name> <path>
To save it.
open <name>
To open it.
open works this way:
Finds file named <name> and then puts content to variable a.
os.system("start {}".format(a))
Think: what could happen if there were spaces in path?

Labels (only in programs):
To define a label start with ':' and then type it's name:
:label
To go to any label type:
goto label

Control-Flow (speak as fast as you can! :D):
if <equation_or_somethin'>[:] <cmd>
Don't put spaces in equation_or_something.
You can use ':' after equation or just leave it.
e.g.
if $a=='lol': output hello
if 3456*9876!=1.5 goto somewhere

Other SCmds:
pause - Wait for user to press the famous 'any-key'.
getKey <var> - Put in <var> single key (always a string).
input <var> - Save to <var> whole sentence.

Nic - She can turn any value into Nothing. Wait wait wait...

Let me expalin this:
Nothing - No thing.
It has opposite meaning than a thing.
Means that there is no thing.
If there is no thing, then what's really here?
