# SyztemLoader.

I don't really know how to describe what is it, so I will just write here the functions.

syz.bat:
Just helps programs start.

Nowy plik wsadowy Windows.bat (New batch file Windows.bat or something):
It should be deleted long time ago....

config.py:
Used to make changes in load.txt.

load.txt:
There is everything that Syztem need to orientate in directories. I could make this automatic but it is more fun.

syztem.py:
Module. Offers baisc functions like removing files etc. (Will offer that soon).
Also things like SCommands (explained later).

exec.py:
Main file. Brings program to life.
Things will work in this scope/environment or something like this. More info in code's comemnts.
